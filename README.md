# chromatica

Simple compile-time colors for Rust.  Implements the CSS color space as named constants.
Doesn't have any run-time information about them.  I wanted the most bone-simple setup,
so I made it.

Similar crates:

 * `tint` -- Use this if you want string-to-color conversions.
 * `palette` -- Use this if you want lots of color space conversions and such.
 * `scarlet` -- Similar to `palette`.
